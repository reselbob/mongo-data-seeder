  - [Running as a Docker Container](#running-as-a-docker-container)

## Structure of Random Data

The structure of the document that will be stored in the MongoDB database is:

* firstName: `string`
* lastName: `string`
* email: `string`
* phone: `string`
* dob: `Date`
* created: `Date`


## Installation

To install the dependency packages for `mongo-data-seeder` and the [Typescript compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) (`tsc`) execute the following command:

`sudo npm run build`

## Testing

To run the test you need either an instance of MongoDB running on your local computer or an access to an instance of MongoDB running in the cloud, for example on [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

**IMPORTANT!!!**  If you're testing by running against an external instance of MongoDB, you need to tell `seeder` the location of the remote instance as well as the credentials required to access it. You do this by adding the required information as a URL attached to the environment variable, `MONGODB_URL`.

You can put the environment variable information in a `.env` file. That `.env` file needs to be at the root of the project file system.

The following is an example of using the `echo` command to inject the environment variable and value into the file, `.env`.

```
 echo MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://cooluser:9EI0O0xxxxxxRR11@cluster0.oewnd.mongodb.net/seeder > .env
```

To verify that `MONGODB_URL` has been injected into the file, `.env`, execute the following command:

`cat .env`

Once database access is implemented, either locally or on the cloud, run the following command:

`npm test`

You'll get output similar to the following:

```
> mongo-data-seeder@0.0.5 test /home/reselbob/mongo-data-seeder
> mocha -r ts-node/register src/tests/test.ts --exit

## Using `mongo-data-seeder` as a Command Line Utility

To get the `mongo-data-seeder` running as a command line utility, run the following command as `sudo`:

`sudo npm run deploy`

It will take a minute or two for the utility to install. The utility's name is `seeder`. When the installation process is finished you'll see the `--help` output as follows:

```
Usage: index.ts - m <MongoDB_CONNECTION_URL> (optional) -r <ROWS_OF_RANDOM_DATA> (optional) -c <MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME> (optional)

Options:
  -u, --url-mongodb    The URL representing a connection string to a remote instance of MongoDB. Defaults to mongodb://localhost:27017/.  [string]
  -r, --rows           The  number of rows of random data to inject into the MongoDB database. Defaults to 10.  [string]
  -d, --database-name  The name of the database in which to store the random data. Defaults to seeder.  [string]
  -h, --help           Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version        Show version number  [boolean]

```

Now you can use `seeder` as a command line utility.

The following is an example of using `seeder` to randomly generate data to a fictitious remote MongoDB database at `mongodb+srv://cooluser:9EI0O0xxxxxxRR11@cluster0.oewnd.mongodb.net/seeder`:

```
seeder -u mongodb+srv://cooluser:9EI0O0xxxxxxRR11@cluster0.oewnd.mongodb.net/seeder
```

You'll get results similar to the following:

## Running as a Docker Container

To run `mongo-data-seeder` from within a Docker container, take the following steps:

**Step 1:** Clone the source code for this project into your development environment:

`git clone https://github.com/reselbob/mongo-data-seeder.git`

**Step 2:** Go to the source code directory.

`cd mongo-data-seeder`

**Step 3:** Build the Docker image, which will be named, `seeder`:

`docker build -t seeder .`

**Step 4:** Create a container using the Docker image named, `seeder`. Run the container so that you can access the source code working directory from a command line within the container. The name of the container will be `myseeder`.

Execute the following command to execute the tasks described above:

`docker run --name myseeder --rm -ti  seeder /bin/bash`

You'll get output similar to the following:

`root@c898ded1dad7:/app#`

**Step 5:** Deploy `seeder` at the container's command line by executing the following command:

`npm run deploy`

You'll get output similar to the following:

```
.
.
.
Options:
  -u, --url-mongodb    The URL representing a connection string to a remote instance of MongoDB. Defaults to mongodb://localhost:27017/.  [string]
  -r, --rows           The  number of rows of random data to inject into the MongoDB database. Defaults to 10.  [string]
  -d, --database-name  The name of the database in which to store the random data. Defaults to seeder.  [string]
  -h, --help           Show help  [boolean]
  -v, --version        Show version number  [boolean]

```

You can now enter a `seeder` command similar to the following to inject random data into the fictitious MongoDB database found at, `mongodb+srv://cooluser:9EI0O0xxxxxxRR11@cluster0.oewnd.mongodb.net/seeder` :

`seeder -u mongodb+srv://cooluser:9EI0O0xxxxxxRR11@cluster0.oewnd.mongodb.net/seeder`

**Step 6:** To exit the container and delete it from your development environment, type ...

`exit`

... at the container's command line.

**Step 7:** To removed Docker image, `seeder` from your development environment, type:

`docker image rm -f seeder`
